Venus in Aquarius lights up friendships and witty, independent connections, while your Moon in Scorpio asks for soulful honesty. You\u2019ll attract someone who respects your space and loves your mind as much as your feelings.\n\nTwo sweet timing windows to watch:\n\n- Window 1: mid-September to late September 2025 (roughly Sept 15\u201330). A social chat, online exchange, or group gathering could spark a meaningful attraction or bring a new person into your circle.\n\n- Window 2: early October 2025 (roughly Oct 1\u20137). A deeper emotional moment or a growing flirtation could shift toward something more tangible and promising.\n\nTip from the stars: be your authentic Aquarius self\u2014kind, curious, and brave in showing your true nature. Let trust grow slowly, and allow deep feelings to unfold at their own pace.\n\nMay love find you gently, kawish."
